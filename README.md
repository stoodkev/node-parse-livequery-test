Simple node code to test liveQueries with parse-server <a href="https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server-example">example</a>.

Change your AppId, MasterKey, address of your server and the class of liveQuery you are testing (the same as server side), then run:

````npm install```` <br/>
````node main.js````

Also, to create a new object without using cURL for testing the liveQuery (and in the meantime testing the insertion of photos or videos), you can run this:

````node testFile.js````
